# sally-webhook-bot
This script runs every minute and checks whether or not a limited time stage is available in the game LINE Rangers. It sends a ping to an associated server to notify its members of the stage's opening.

## Packages Required
1. [APScheduler](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/)
2. [discord-webhook](https://pypi.org/project/discord-webhook/)

## TO-DO
This was just a quick program to get acclimated with Git control system, Python, and to some degree online hosting. The next step is to figure out how to bundle this properly to run somewhere online 24/7.
